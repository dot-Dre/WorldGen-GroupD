# D&D World Generator Project Requirements

## Overview:

The goal of this project is to develop a D&D World Generator. This tool will generate randomized D&D maps with an emphasis on a diverse range of geographical elements, challenging terrain, and interesting narrative components. The map generator will cater to both the players and the Dungeon Master (DM), allowing for dynamic, immersive gameplay.

The generator will require no necessary user input for map layout, meaning the maps will be entirely procedurally generated, taking the burden of world-building off of the DM and players and allowing them to focus on the story and characters. The narrative component tied to the maps will serve as a foundation for the DM to create adventures.

## Project Requirements:

1. **Random Map Generator:**
    - The system should generate random maps without needing any user input regarding layout such as placing walls or rooms.
    - The maps should be diverse and unique to maintain a high replayability value.
    - The generator should consider a variety of terrain and geographical elements, incorporating them organically into the generated map.

2. **User Views:**
    - There should be two distinct user views:
        - **Player View:** This view should feature a "Fog of War" effect, obscuring parts of the map that the player's character has not yet explored.
        - **Dungeon Master View:** This view should present the entire map, allowing the Dungeon Master to navigate the unfolding narrative.

3. **Narrative (Environmental Storytelling):**
    - Each map should have embedded environmental storytelling elements that contribute to the narrative of the game. These can be through the placement and structure of geographic features, the layout of structures, or even the presence (or absence) of certain creatures or items.
    - The generator should create a sense of history and depth in the map, making the environment an active part of the storytelling.
    - These environmental cues should be open to interpretation by the Dungeon Master and players, allowing them to weave these elements into their unique story.


4. **Theme:**
    - The theme for the maps is up to the development team. It could range from traditional fantasy settings to more exotic or unique themes. The theme choice should be communicated and approved by the client.
    - The theme chosen should influence the narrative and the elements generated in the map.

5. **Resource and Timeline:**
    - The project is estimated to take around 900 hours of work to complete, distributed among the six-person team.
    - The project has a budget for additional resources. The team can request paid content from the client, within a budget of around $20.

The final deliverable will be a functional, easy-to-use D&D World Generator that can create diverse and unique maps for exciting and immersive gameplay.

(Note: All requirements are subject to adjustments and clarifications during the course of the project, after discussion and agreement with the client.)
