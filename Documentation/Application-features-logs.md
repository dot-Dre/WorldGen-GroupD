# Application Features

## As of 08/08/23

### a). Random Map Generator
__Description:__
This is one of the key components for the MVP of the project. Specific details of the generator can be found on the 'scope back end' issue. The team has decided that the minimum scope of the generator, will be a 'Dungeon' map generator. The randomness of the map should be somewhat informed by a narrative. Maps of this nature will be composed of:

1. Layout Complexity
2. Rooms and Chambers
3. Corridors and Passageways
4. Key Landmarks
5. Traps
6. Treasure and Loot
7. Secrets and Hidden Areas
8. Puzzles and Challenges
9. Themes and Atmosphere

__Motivation:__
The team has decided on this initial scope because the team wants to design and produce an immersive map, so the team wants to dedicae time and resources for this, rather than needing to spread it across designing World, Town, City maps etc.

### b). Saving and loading maps

__Description:__ This feature allows users to save the generated dungeon map configurations. Saved maps can be revisited or shared later.

__Motivation:__ Players can preserve interesting or useful maps for future reference, ensuring that captivating layouts are not lost after generating new maps.

### c). Dungeon Master View

__Description:__ The Dungeon Master (DM) view displays the entire generated map layout. DMs can strategize encounters, plan narrative events,and guide players through the adventure.

__Motivation:__ DMs require a comprehensive view to orchestrate gameplay effectively. This feature empowers them to prepare and deliver immersive experiences without the need for map editing.

### d) Player View

__Description:__ The Player view reveals portions of the map in accordance with player exploration. Unexplored areas remain hidden behind a fog of war, heightening anticipation and discovery.

__Motivation:__ The dynamic fog of war mechanic adds excitement and authenticity to player exploration, encouraging cautious tactics and reinforcing the unknown nature of the environment. This feature will enrichen the online experience on the web-app.

### e) Allow users to print the Map on A4 piece of paper
__Description:__ Users can print the generated dungeon map on a standard A4-sized piece of paper. The printed map captures the layout and details for offline reference.

__Motivation:__ Printed maps are invaluable tools during physical tabletop sessions. This feature ensures that players have a tangible visual aid to enhance their in-person gameplay experience.

### f) Ideally Multiplayer
__Description:__ Multiplayer functionality enables multiple users to view and interact with the generated maps simultaneously. Participants can explore, discuss, and plan strategies together.

__Motivation:__ Multiplayer support fosters collaborative decision-making and engagement among players and the DM. It enables shared exploration and discussion of tactics, even when playing remotely.
